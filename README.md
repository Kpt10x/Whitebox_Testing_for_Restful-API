#  Enhanced White-Box Testing for RESTful APIs using Search-Based Methods

This project demonstrates enhanced white-box testing strategies for RESTful APIs, integrating dynamic testing (using `unittest` + `hypothesis`) and **search-based test case generation** via **genetic algorithms** (`pygad`).

---
## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. 📦 Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Start the API

        From the root folder:

                python api/sample-api/src/app.py
        Leave this terminal open. The API will run at:
        http://127.0.0.1:5000

### 3. 🧪 Run Tests (in a new terminal)

    python -m unittest discover -s test-suite/test_cases

### 4. 🧬 Run Genetic Test Generator (Optional)

    python genetic_testing/genetic_test_gen.py

### 5. 📈 Generate Coverage Report

    coverage run --source=api/sample-api/src -m unittest discover -s test-suite/test_cases
    coverage report -m
    coverage html

    Then open the HTML coverage report:

    start htmlcov/index.html

    OR just use:

    .\setup.ps1


📎 Notes

    Make sure your Flask API is running on http://localhost:5000

    The GA will interact with the /users POST endpoint

    Coverage includes both white-box API logic and test generation code
